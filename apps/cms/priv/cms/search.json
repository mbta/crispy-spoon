          "Overview This page is a guide to creating beautiful, compelling content on the MBTA's Drupal CMS. It walks through the tools that the CMS provides to content authors, and provides some tips and tricks to using them well. The Drupal system allows content authors to create content of a various types: events, pages, \"What's Happening\" items that appear on the home page, and more. Each of these content types include a custom set of fields to collect data, so that they appear consistent across the site. Most of these fields are simple to use, but two of them use powerful tools that have their own sets of best practices. Those two tools are: The WYSIWYG Editor \"Paragraphs\" The WYSIWYG Editor The \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG) editor is a powerful text entry tool that is used in many places in the CMS to enter \"rich text\" – which is text that includes things like italics, headers, links, and tables – without having to write HTML code. Over time we've come up with a few \"best practices\" to use this editor well: When adding links to other pages on the MBTA site, use \"relative URLs\" that begin with a forward slash. For example, use link to \"/accessibility/trip_logistics\" instead of \"https://t.mbta.com/accessibility/trip-logistics\". Use hyphens (\"-\") instead of underscores (\"_\") when creating URLs. All external URLs need to include either \"http\" or \"https\". For example, use \"https://www.mbta.com\" instead of just \"www.mbta.com\". Prefer \"https\" if the page works with it. Paragraphs Complex pages can be built out of a set of building blocks called \"paragraphs\". These features are pre-built widgets that collect a bit of information and render themselves in an interesting way. Both the \"Basic Page\" and \"Landing Page\" content types support paragraphs. To see a list of all available paragraphs and how to use them, please visit the Paragraphs Guide ."

As a result, Governor Baker convened a special panel to investigate why the MBTA was struggling and how it might improve. That panel recommended forming a board to closely monitor the T’s finances, management, and operations over the following 3-5 years. The Fiscal and Management Control Board (FMCB) was established on July 17, 2015, and has met on a near-weekly basis since to help get the T back on track. Each FMCB meeting starts with a section for public comments on any topic on that day’s agenda. The core issues the FMCB seeks to address are: Unsustainable operating budget Underinvestment in infrastructure Difficulty completing projects Ineffective workplace practices Lack of long-term vision and strategy Leadership changes and staffing issues Lack of customer focus Inefficient contracting Lack of accountability to the Governor and Legislature",

Presenting Mr. Sanborn with a commendation, MBTA General Manager Daniel A. Grabauskas made the following statement: George Sanborn is the recently retired Reference Librarian from our State Transportation Library. After 37 years of service, he has often been fondly referred to as the “T historian.” For those who use our library for research: authors, artists, film makers, employees of the MBTA, other transportation agencies, the general public and the academic community, Mr. Sanborn has been a trusted guide. His unwavering commitment to historical fact and his unrivaled knowledge of transportation is evidenced by his notoriety on local as well as national levels. He is a noted reference point for premier publications, including National Geographic and Smithsonian. Locally, he has appeared on WCVB’s news show, Chronicle and the Boston Globe has also relied on George’s expertise for questions that appeared in “Ask the Globe.” George is a popular lecturer on the history of the MBTA, and has spoken to groups such as the American Public Transportation Association and the “700” Club. George is an honored member of the National Railway Historical Society and a Trustee of the Trolley Museum. Above all, he has demonstrated exemplary performance on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and her citizens. We thank him for his professionalism over the years, as he continues to share his passion for the history of transportation while in retirement. We wish George Sanborn well and hope we can call on him in the future, because he is truly irreplaceable.",
